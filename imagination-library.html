            <p>Our main goal for this project was to identify and solve issues surrounding information architecture and hierarchy, navigation, and usability. With those goals in mind we reached out to the Imagination Library of Grant County, with whom one of our team members had a connection with, and asked them if we could take a stab at updating their platform, to which we were warmly given an okay! Needless to say, we were thrilled. Here’s how it went!</p>

We had a turnout of 13 results, which cumulatively validated our initial concerns. We recorded some of the more notable impressions that we felt gave us the most direction.</p>

                <p>To begin we set up question based interviews aimed at attaining a sense of what general attitudes towards nonprofits were. We then organized an affinity diagram, so we could organize the ideas that we came away with and thought were relevant perspectives towards appealing to user desires, needs and preferences. We laid out our notes and associated them with a general list of topics.</p>

                        <p>Our second step was to restructure the site’s information hierarchy entirely. With the overly convoluted site map we laid out previously, we felt that quicker access to key points of interest was a mainstay logistical point that needed to be covered before any further movement. We took the previous 34 pages, and reduced them down to 10. This gave us a clearer idea of our ore practical tasks:</p>

                <p>Following our site remapping, we thought about item number one: the best way to visually organize everything. As we brainstormed, we noticed that one standout issue that our research yielded was that the site was overly text heavy. That, in addition to already having  to reconsolidate existing information, seemed like a significant hurdle for us. We decided that the best was to present users with the information they wanted was to allow them to access what they wanted, at their speed using carousels/cards. This idea helped avoid scrolling fatigue, and required minimal searching through the page for pertinent information, so we ran with it, and developed some lofi wireframes to go forward with.</p>

                <p>Next we began ideating on what we thought the best aesthetic direction was. Since the site serves as a platform for a nonprofit centered around children, we thought about how we could best bring out the childhood excitement of reading in our design. We knew we wanted to signal the child centered nature of the nonprofit, while also making the visuals refined enough for adults to enjoy as well. We collaged together a mood board with some of the following visuals serving as our basis, focusing on colors as a primary point of interest.</p>

        <div class="ideationB5">
            <div class="p1">
                <p>Based on our inspiration from our moodboard, we devised a style guide that was inline with the colors and feelings we wanted users to experience. We decided on a pallet that bordered on pastelle-esque, but aired towards a saturation that was just bright enough to still be able to pop where we wanted it to.</p>

            <div class="p1">
                <p>As we finalized some of our basic stylistic choices, we began working on some mid-fidelity iterations that took some pages from our original lo-fi mockups. With grant county New Mexico in mind, one of our main iterations was heavily centric around a cutout mesa background. Another of our heading iterations was more focused around iconography more centric to the imagination Library itself, rather than the identity of the branch.</p>

                <p>While both of our main contenders had features we were all drawn to, neither one accomplished everything we’d wanted. We took the best aspects of both and combined them in a way that we felt was both visually and technically accomplishing what we’d been aiming for. Our end result accomplishes our goals:

                <p>As we concluded our final product we felt we succeeded in many areas, while also having many places where we felt we had room to improve. Our process during our mid-fi iteration phase could have been more organized and efficient, as we could have spent less time getting caught on small details and pre-planning.
