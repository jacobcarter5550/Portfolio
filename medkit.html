            <p>Having lived with Cocid-19 for almost a full year now, my team and I came together and thought about some of the biggest issues we all felt were affecting us the most, on the day to day. Just amongst ourselves we felt that news was hard to keep up with, maintaining social health was just as challenging, and keeping track of where we could get which treatments was also confusing. We put our heads together to come up with Medkit.</p>

                <p>With the conceptual structure of our platform put together, we began to softly frame out some sections of the app. We started by tackling what we thought the first couple hurdles that we felt really needed to get right were:  the way that news was presented to users and the reminders that users had when they were in the app.</p>

                    <p>We tried not to spend too much time reinventing the wheel, however when we initially started working on what would eventually be the Info Hub, we experimented with a few rudimentary layouts for what we thought a good delivery of info would look like.</p>

                    <p>When it came to reminders and events within the app, our philosophy was centered around avoiding the user having to search for their scheduled event, whether it’s a test, or a social meeting.

                        <br>
                    We ultimately ended up having the event-reminder tab be subjective to which tab users were on; if a user were in Health Spot, they’d see a reminder for their testing appointment, but not the virtual event they signed up for.

                <p>After having thought out loud through our wireframes, we turned to some more mid-fidelity thinking, and began to lay out some of our styling preferences. Our design philosophy was in an unusual predicament; we wanted to convey the trust and reassurance of a medical app, but that’s not what Medkit was. We ended up combining some tropes from medical apps, white backgrounds, solid colors, and filled buttons, with glass-morphism. We felt that the aesthetic that glassmorphism had worked well with the pseudo-medical effect that we were pining for </p>

                <p>Once our visual direction had been set in place, we began to iterate on some of our lofi mockups, applying our current stylistic choices onto them. Initially throughout our first phases, we leaned too heavily on glass-morphism as a basis, but near the end, there was a more equal distribution on glass-on-solid stylings.</p>

                        Nearer to some of our more final iterations, we circled back to the desire to include our primary red consistently into our interface, however we felt that it’s presence would be more of an indication of danger or urgency, and dialed back its presence.

                <p>Stepping away from our final product to take a look was exciting. We were all really happy with how things turned out, and while we felt we’d successfully created something that satisfied the vision we shared, we of course saw ways that our process could’ve improved. We felt like some areas of our development, iterating on lofi mockups to mid-fi, for example, could have been a bit more expeditious. We also felt that some potentially important features were missing from our final product; we listed some of our further additions and iterations below.</p>

                <li class="p3">
                    <p>Build out a fully realized feature to access test results</p>

                <li class="p3">
                    <p>Expand platform’s capabilities to be applicable outside of Covid-19, potentially expanding to focus on mental health, new strains of Covid, or other viruses</p>

                <li class="p3">
                    <p>Build a feature that tracks Covid statistics based on state and county, eventually international tracking</p>

                    <p>Flesh out ‘registration’ sign up flow in the Community section</p>

                <p>This project was one of our favorites to work on, and was a product of some of our best collaboration. I hope you enjoyed the journey.</p>
